# Contributing to UIXO

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **UIXO** 🎉
UIXO is an open-source project maintained by **UXICORELABS** and built together with the community.

To keep the project clean, stable, and easy to maintain, we follow clear contribution and commit rules. Please read this file carefully before contributing.

## Ways to Contribute

You can contribute in many ways:

* Fix bugs
* Add new features
* Improve UI components
* Improve documentation
* Add templates
* Suggest ideas or improvements

All contributions are welcome if they respect the project values.

---

## Commit Message Rules (Very Important)

UIXO follows a **strict commit message format**.

### Required Format

```
type(scope): short message
```

### Examples

```
feat(editor): add drag and drop support for layout blocks
fix(preview): resolve live preview refresh issue
chore(readme): update project description
docs(contributing): add commit message rules
refactor(core): simplify component state handling
```

---

## Allowed Commit Types

Use **only** these types:

* `feat` → New feature
* `fix` → Bug fix
* `docs` → Documentation only changes
* `chore` → Maintenance, config, tooling
* `refactor` → Code change that improves structure without changing behavior
* `test` → Adding or updating tests
* `style` → Formatting only (no logic change)

---

## Scope Guidelines

The `scope` should describe **what part of the project is affected**.

Common scopes:

* `core`
* `editor`
* `ui`
* `preview`
* `export`
* `ai`
* `docs`
* `readme`
* `build`
* `config`

Example:

```
feat(editor): add component resize handles
```

---

## Commit Message Rules

Please follow these rules:

* Use **present tense**
  ✅ `add`, ❌ `added`
* Keep messages **short and clear**
* Do **not** end the message with a period
* One commit = one logical change
* Avoid vague messages like:

  * `update code`
  * `fix issue`
  * `changes`

Bad ❌

```
fix: stuff
```

Good ✅

```
fix(editor): prevent crash when deleting root layout
```

---

## Pull Request Rules

Before opening a PR:

* Make sure the code builds
* Follow commit rules
* Keep PRs focused and small
* Explain **what** and **why**, not just how

PRs that ignore commit rules may be asked to fix commits before merge.

---

## Code of Conduct

* Be respectful
* Be patient
* Be constructive
* No ego-driven behavior

UIXO values calm discussion and thoughtful collaboration.

---

## Project Governance

UIXO is maintained by **UXICORELABS**.

* Maintainers review and merge PRs

* Community feedback matters

This project is committed to staying open source and community-first.

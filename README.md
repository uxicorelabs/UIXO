# **UIXO**

**Visual UI building with real code — assisted by AI, powered by the community.**

UIXO is an open-source visual UI builder that helps developers create clean, modern user interfaces faster, without giving up control over their code.

Built and maintained by **UXICORELABS**, UIXO follows a structure-first approach to UI creation, with optional AI-assisted design and clean, readable code output that developers can trust.

## **What Is UIXO?**

UIXO lets you:

* Build UI **visually**
* Define **structure first** (layout, components, hierarchy)
* Use AI to **apply styling and design**
* See **live preview and live code**
* Edit everything at any time
* Export **clean, production-ready code**

No black-box generation.
No locked platform.
No hidden logic.

You build the structure.
AI assists the design.
You own the code.

## **How UIXO Works**

1. Create UI structure using a visual editor
2. Add components like buttons, inputs, forms, layouts
3. Optionally prompt AI, for example:

   > “Make this a clean SaaS-style login page”
4. See instant visual updates
5. View and edit the generated code in real time
6. Export code and continue work anywhere

UIXO is designed to **support developers**, not replace them.
